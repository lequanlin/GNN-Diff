# GNN-Diff: Boost Graph Neural Networks with Minimal Hyperparameter Tuning

## Description
This is the code for the paper "Diffusing to the Top: Boost Graph Neural Networks with Minimal Hyperparameter Tuning".

GNN-Diff is a graph-conditioned diffusion framework that generates high-performing parameters for a target GNN to match or even surpass the results of time-consuming hyperparameter tuning with a much more efficient process.
